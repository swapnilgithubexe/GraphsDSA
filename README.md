# Python Graphs DSA

This repository contains a Python implementation of graphs for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The repository focuses on representing graphs using adjacency matrices, supporting both weighted and unweighted graphs.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**:
  - **Unweighted Graphs**: Represented using an adjacency matrix where `1` indicates the presence of an edge and `0` indicates no edge.
  - **Weighted Graphs**: Represented using an adjacency matrix where the matrix cell value indicates the weight of the edge between two nodes. A value of `0` indicates no edge.

- **Graph Operations**:
  - Add vertices
  - Add edges
  - Display the adjacency matrix
  - Display the adjacency List
  - Check connectivity
